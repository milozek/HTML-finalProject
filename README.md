### Introduction

This is a prototype for my first ambitious web3 project, where i intend to combine art and storytelling for the ulter creation of a game, which will include the use of technologies such as NFTs, ChatGPT3 and Metamask wallet connection for the usage of the game.

Here is the first draft of the frontend, made with HTML5, CSS3, SASS and Bootstrap. The further development will be made with Nodejs, Reactjs, Typescript, Solidity and Hardhat, also using OpenZeppelin for the deployment of the ERC-721 (NFTs). As a student I'm deploying this prototype for the last pre-delivery of the Final Project in CoderHouse of the HTML/CSS course
